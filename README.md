I’m Pikaptain. You can call me... Hum, no, don't call me.

I like programming. And playing videogames. And drawing.

I've learned Python.

I’m currently learning Java Script. Because I'm working on a Minecraft mod. For the Java Edition.

Pronouns: Nobody. Or someone. I said don't call me, so you don't need to know that.

Fun fact 1: Everyone around me says that I'm good at drawing. I don't know if it's true. Maybe it is. Or maybe it isn't. I don't know.

Fun fact 2: I like playing videogames but I'm not good at it. But I'm still playing. I don't know why. And you won't know why. Because I don't know why.

Fun fact 3: There's no more information about me.

Good bye.
